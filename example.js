 * These are keyword helper functions.  They convert simple strings into regular-expressions
 * that can be composed using operators more easily.  This library calls such a regular-expression
 * a "phrase".
 * 
 * - `LIT` creates an exact-match phrase.
 * - `PRE` creates a prefix phrase, meaning the start of the string must match.
 * - `POST` creates a postfix phrase, meaning the end of the string must match.
 * - `OPEN` creates a phrase that will match any part of a word; it is open-ended.
 * 
 * If you provide a raw string into an entry's `keys`, it will default to using `PRE`, so using
 * that helper directly is seldom necessary.
