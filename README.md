# NovelAI Lorebook Helper
This simple script is a tool to build `*.lorebook` files that feature more complex regular-expression
keys and simplifies creating focused relationships between entries.

## Try Online
There is a [RunKit playground](https://runkit.com/taleirofdeynai/novelai-lorebook-helper) setup that does a good job of explaining the script and allows you play with it in your browser without needing to install Node.

## Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for your OS.
2. Pull or download this repo so you have your own copy.
3. Using your command-line software of choice, navigate to the directory you placed it.
4. Run the example with: `node ./example.js`
5. Assuming everything is installed correctly, an `example.lorebook` file will be output into the directory.
6. Customize!  The generated `.lorebook` can be imported into your story.

## Usage
Check out `example.js` to see how the script is used.

You can use this example as a basis for your own lorebook, however, using this script effectively requires some programming and JavaScript knowledge.
